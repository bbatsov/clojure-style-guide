This Clojure style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Clojure
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Clojure
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all -- no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted, I've
assumed that it's pretty obvious).

I didn't come up with all the rules out of nowhere; they are mostly
based on my extensive career as a professional software engineer,
feedback and suggestions from members of the Clojure community, and
various highly regarded Clojure programming resources, such as
http://www.clojurebook.com/["Clojure Programming"]
and http://joyofclojure.com/["The Joy of Clojure"].

NOTE: The guide is still a work in progress; some sections are missing,
others are incomplete, some rules are lacking examples, some rules
don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough. In due time
these issues will be addressed -- just keep them in mind for now.
Help us address those shortcomings and make this guide better together!

Please note, that the Clojure developing community maintains a list of
https://clojure.org/community/contrib_howto#_coding_guidelines[coding standards for libraries],
too.

== Source Code Layout & Organization

[quote, Jerry Coffin (on indentation)]
____
Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
probably right...
____

=== Tabs vs Spaces [[spaces]]

Use *spaces* for indentation. No hard tabs.

=== Body Indentation [[body-indentation]]

Use 2 spaces to indent the bodies of
forms that have body parameters.  This covers all `def` forms, special
forms and macros that introduce local bindings (e.g. `loop`, `let`,
`when-let`) and many macros like `when`, `cond`, `+as->+`, `+cond->+`, `case`,
`with-*`, etc.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(when something
  (something-else))

(with-out-str
  (println "Hello, ")
  (println "world!"))

;; bad - four spaces
(when something
    (something-else))

;; bad - one space
(with-out-str
 (println "Hello, ")
 (println "world!"))
----

=== Function Arguments Alignment [[vertically-align-fn-args]]

Vertically align function (macro) arguments spanning multiple lines.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(filter even?
        (range 1 10))

;; bad
(filter even?
  (range 1 10))
----

=== Arguments Indentation [[one-space-indent]]

Use a single space indentation for function (macro) arguments
when there are no arguments on the same line as the function name.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(filter
 even?
 (range 1 10))

(or
 ala
 bala
 portokala)

;; bad - two-space indent
(filter
  even?
  (range 1 10))

(or
  ala
  bala
  portokala)
----

=== Bindings Alignment [[bindings-alignment]]

Vertically align `let` (and `let`-like) bindings.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(let [thing1 "some stuff"
      thing2 "other stuff"]
  (foo thing1 thing2))

;; bad
(let [thing1 "some stuff"
  thing2 "other stuff"]
  (foo thing1 thing2))
----

=== Map Keys Alignment [[map-keys-alignment]]

Align vertically map keys.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
{:thing1 thing1
 :thing2 thing2}

;; bad
{:thing1 thing1
:thing2 thing2}

;; bad
{:thing1 thing1
  :thing2 thing2}
----

=== Line Endings [[crlf]]

Use Unix-style line endings.footnote:[*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are
covered by default, Windows users have to be extra careful.]

[TIP]
====
If you're using Git you might want to add the following
configuration setting to protect your project from Windows line
endings creeping in:

[source,shell]
----
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
----
====

=== Bracket Spacing [[bracket-spacing]]

If any text precedes an opening bracket(`(`, `{` and
`[`) or follows a closing bracket(`)`, `}` and `]`), separate that
text from that bracket with a space. Conversely, leave no space after
an opening bracket and before following text, or after preceding text
and before a closing bracket.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(foo (bar baz) quux)

;; bad
(foo(bar baz)quux)
(foo ( bar baz ) quux)
----

=== No Commas in Sequential Collection Literals [[no-commas-for-seq-literals]]

[quote, Alan Perlis]
____
Syntactic sugar causes semicolon cancer.
____

Don't use commas between the elements of sequential collection literals.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
[1 2 3]
(1 2 3)

;; bad
[1, 2, 3]
(1, 2, 3)
----

=== Optional Commas In Map Literals [[opt-commas-in-map-literals]]

Consider enhancing the readability of map literals via judicious use
of commas and line breaks.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
{:name "Bruce Wayne" :alter-ego "Batman"}

;; good and arguably a bit more readable
{:name "Bruce Wayne"
 :alter-ego "Batman"}

;; good and arguably more compact
{:name "Bruce Wayne", :alter-ego "Batman"}
----

=== Gather Trailing Parentheses [[gather-trailing-parens]]

Place all trailing parentheses on a single line instead of distinct lines.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good; single line
(when something
  (something-else))

;; bad; distinct lines
(when something
  (something-else)
)
----

=== Empty Lines Between Top Level Forms [[empty-lines-between-top-level-forms]]

Use a single empty line between top-level forms.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def x ...)

(defn foo ...)

;; bad
(def x ...)
(defn foo ...)

;; bad
(def x ...)


(defn foo ...)
----

An exception to the rule is the grouping of related ``def``s together.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def min-rows 10)
(def max-rows 20)
(def min-cols 15)
(def max-cols 30)
----

=== No Blank Lines Within Definition Forms [[no-blank-lines-within-def-forms]]

Do not place blank lines in the middle of a function or
macro definition.  An exception can be made to indicate grouping of
pairwise constructs as found in e.g. `let` and `cond`.

[#80-character-limits]
=== Maximum Line Length [[line-length]]

Where feasible, avoid making lines longer than 80 characters.

=== No Trailing Whitespace [[no-trailing-whitespace]]

Avoid trailing whitespace.

=== One File Per Namespace [[one-file-per-namespace]]

Use one file per namespace and one namespace per file.

----
;; good 
(ns foo.bar)

;; bad 
(ns foo.bar)
(ns baz.qux)

;; bad
(in-ns quux.quuz)
(in-ns quuz.corge)

;; bad 
(ns foo.bar) or (in-ns foo.bar) in multiple files
----

== Namespace Declaration

=== No Single Segment Namespaces [[no-single-segment-namespaces]]

Avoid single-segment namespaces.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(ns example.ns)

;; bad
(ns example)
----

=== Namespace Segments Limit [[namespace-segments-limit]]

Avoid the use of overly long namespaces (i.e., more than 5 segments).

=== Comprehensive `ns` Form [[comprehensive-ns-declaration]]

Start every namespace with a comprehensive `ns` form, comprised of
``refer``s, ``require``s, and ``import``s, conventionally in that order.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns examples.ns
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [next replace remove])
  (:require [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]])
  (:import java.util.Date))
----

=== Line Breaks in `ns` [[line-break-ns-declaration]]

When there are multiple dependencies, you may want give each one its own line. 
This facilitates sorting, readability, and cleaner diffs for dependency changes.

[source,clojure]
----
;; better
(ns examples.ns
  (:require
   [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]]
   [clojure.set :as set]
   [clojure.java.shell :as sh])
  (:import
   java.util.Date
   java.text.SimpleDateFormat
   [java.util.concurrent Executors
                         LinkedBlockingQueue]))

;; good
(ns examples.ns
  (:require [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]]
            [clojure.set :as set]
            [clojure.java.shell :as sh])
  (:import java.util.Date
           java.text.SimpleDateFormat
           [java.util.concurrent Executors
                                 LinkedBlockingQueue]))

;; bad
(ns examples.ns
  (:require [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]] [clojure.set :as set] [clojure.java.shell :as sh])
  (:import java.util.Date java.text.SimpleDateFormat [java.util.concurrent Executors LinkedBlockingQueue]))
----

=== Prefer `:require` Over `:use` [[prefer-require-over-use]]

In the `ns` form prefer `:require :as` over `:require :refer` over `:require
:refer :all`.  Prefer `:require` over `:use`; the latter form should be
considered deprecated for new code.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(ns examples.ns
  (:require [clojure.zip :as zip]))

;; good
(ns examples.ns
  (:require [clojure.zip :refer [lefts rights]]))

;; acceptable as warranted
(ns examples.ns
  (:require [clojure.zip :refer :all]))

;; bad
(ns examples.ns
  (:use clojure.zip))
----

=== Sort requirements and imports [[sort-requirements-and-imports]]
In the `ns` form, sort your requirements and imports. This facilitates readability and avoids duplication, especially when the list of required / imported namespaces is very long.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(ns examples.ns
  (:require
   [baz.core :as baz]
   [clojure.java.shell :as sh]
   [clojure.set :as set]
   [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]]
   [foo.bar :as foo]))
   
;; bad
(ns examples.ns
  (:require
   [clojure.string :as s :refer [blank?]]
   [clojure.set :as set]
   [baz.core :as baz]
   [foo.bar :as foo]
   [clojure.java.shell :as sh]))
----

== Functions

=== Optional New Line After Fn Name [[optional-new-line-after-fn-name]]

Optionally omit the new line between the function name and argument
vector for `defn` when there is no docstring.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo
  [x]
  (bar x))

;; good
(defn foo [x]
  (bar x))

;; bad
(defn foo
  [x] (bar x))
----

=== Multimethod Dispatch Val Placement [[multimethod-dispatch-val-placement]]

Place the `dispatch-val` of a multimethod on the same line as the
function name.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defmethod foo :bar [x] (baz x))

(defmethod foo :bar
  [x]
  (baz x))

;; bad
(defmethod foo
  :bar
  [x]
  (baz x))

(defmethod foo
  :bar [x]
  (baz x))
----

=== Oneline Short Fn [[oneline-short-fn]]

Optionally omit the new line between the argument vector and a short
function body.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo [x]
  (bar x))

;; good for a small function body
(defn foo [x] (bar x))

;; good for multi-arity functions
(defn foo
  ([x] (bar x))
  ([x y]
   (if (predicate? x)
     (bar x)
     (baz x))))

;; bad
(defn foo
  [x] (if (predicate? x)
        (bar x)
        (baz x)))
----

=== Multiple Arity Indentation [[multiple-arity-indentation]]

Indent each arity form of a function definition vertically aligned with its
parameters.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo
  "I have two arities."
  ([x]
   (foo x 1))
  ([x y]
   (+ x y)))

;; bad - extra indentation
(defn foo
  "I have two arities."
  ([x]
    (foo x 1))
  ([x y]
    (+ x y)))
----

=== Multiple Arity Order [[multiple-arity-order]]

Sort the arities of a function
from fewest to most arguments. The common case of multi-arity
functions is that some K arguments fully specifies the function's
behavior, and that arities N < K partially apply the K arity, and
arities N > K provide a fold of the K arity over varargs.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good - it's easy to scan for the nth arity
(defn foo
  "I have two arities."
  ([x]
   (foo x 1))
  ([x y]
   (+ x y)))

;; okay - the other arities are applications of the two-arity
(defn foo
  "I have two arities."
  ([x y]
   (+ x y))
  ([x]
   (foo x 1))
  ([x y z & more]
   (reduce foo (foo x (foo y z)) more)))

;; bad - unordered for no apparent reason
(defn foo
  ([x] 1)
  ([x y z] (foo x (foo y z)))
  ([x y] (+ x y))
  ([w x y z & more] (reduce foo (foo w (foo x (foo y z))) more)))
----

=== Function Length [[function-length]]

Avoid functions longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most
functions will be shorter than 5 LOC.

=== Function Positional Parameters Limit [[function-positional-parameter-limit]]

Avoid parameter lists with more than three or four positional parameters.

=== Pre and Post Conditions [[pre-post-conditions]]

Prefer function pre and post conditions to checks inside a function's body.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo [x]
  {:pre [(pos? x)]}
  (bar x))

;; bad
(defn foo [x]
  (if (pos? x)
    (bar x)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "x must be a positive number!")))
----

== Idioms

=== Dynamic Namespace Manipulation [[ns-fns-only-in-repl]]

Avoid the use of namespace-manipulating functions like `require` and
`refer`. They are entirely unnecessary outside of a REPL
environment.

=== Forward References [[forward-references]]

Avoid forward references.  They are occasionally necessary, but such occasions
are rare in practice.

=== Declare [[declare]]

Use `declare` to enable forward references when forward references are
necessary.

=== Higher-order Functions [[higher-order-fns]]

Prefer higher-order functions like `map` to `loop/recur`.

=== Vars Inside Functions [[dont-def-vars-inside-fns]]

Don't define vars inside functions.

[source,clojure]
----
;; very bad
(defn foo []
  (def x 5)
  ...)
----

=== Shadowing `clojure.core` Names [[dont-shadow-clojure-core]]

Don't shadow `clojure.core` names with local bindings.

[source,clojure]
----
;; bad - clojure.core/map must be fully qualified inside the function
(defn foo [map]
  ...)
----

=== Alter Var Binding [[alter-var]]

Use `alter-var-root` instead of `def` to change the value of a var.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def thing 1) ; value of thing is now 1
; do some stuff with thing
(alter-var-root #'thing (constantly nil)) ; value of thing is now nil

;; bad
(def thing 1)
; do some stuff with thing
(def thing nil)
; value of thing is now nil
----

=== Nil Punning [[nil-punning]]

Use `seq` as a terminating condition to test whether a sequence is
empty (this technique is sometimes called _nil punning_).

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn print-seq [s]
  (when (seq s)
    (prn (first s))
    (recur (rest s))))

;; bad
(defn print-seq [s]
  (when-not (empty? s)
    (prn (first s))
    (recur (rest s))))
----

=== Converting Sequences to Vectors [[to-vector]]

Prefer `vec` over `into` when you need to convert a sequence into a vector.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(vec some-seq)

;; bad
(into [] some-seq)
----

=== `when` vs `if` [[when-instead-of-single-branch-if]]

Use `when` instead of `(if ... (do ...))`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(when pred
  (foo)
  (bar))

;; bad
(if pred
  (do
    (foo)
    (bar)))
----

=== `if-let` [[if-let]]

Use `if-let` instead of `let` + `if`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(if-let [result (foo x)]
  (something-with result)
  (something-else))

;; bad
(let [result (foo x)]
  (if result
    (something-with result)
    (something-else)))
----

=== `when-let` [[when-let]]

Use `when-let` instead of `let` + `when`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(when-let [result (foo x)]
  (do-something-with result)
  (do-something-more-with result))

;; bad
(let [result (foo x)]
  (when result
    (do-something-with result)
    (do-something-more-with result)))
----

=== `if-not` [[if-not]]

Use `if-not` instead of `(if (not ...) ...)`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(if-not pred
  (foo))

;; bad
(if (not pred)
  (foo))
----

=== `when-not` [[when-not]]

Use `when-not` instead of `(when (not ...) ...)`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(when-not pred
  (foo)
  (bar))

;; bad
(when (not pred)
  (foo)
  (bar))
----

=== `when-not` vs `if-not` [[when-not-instead-of-single-branch-if-not]]

Use `when-not` instead of `(if-not ... (do ...))`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(when-not pred
  (foo)
  (bar))

;; bad
(if-not pred
  (do
    (foo)
    (bar)))
----

=== `not=` [[not-equal]]

Use `not=` instead of `(not (= ...))`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(not= foo bar)

;; bad
(not (= foo bar))
----

=== `printf` [[printf]]

Use `printf` instead of `(print (format ...))`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(printf "Hello, %s!\n" name)

;; ok
(println (format "Hello, %s!" name))
----

=== Flexible Comparison Functions [[multiple-arity-of-gt-and-ls-fns]]

When doing comparisons, keep in mind that Clojure's functions `<`,
`>`, etc. accept a variable number of arguments.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(< 5 x 10)

;; bad
(and (> x 5) (< x 10))
----

=== Single Param Fn Literal [[single-param-fn-literal]]

Prefer `%` over `%1` in function literals with only one parameter.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
#(Math/round %)

;; bad
#(Math/round %1)
----

=== Multiple Params Fn Literal [[multiple-params-fn-literal]]

Prefer `%1` over `%` in function literals with more than one parameter.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
#(Math/pow %1 %2)

;; bad
#(Math/pow % %2)
----

=== No Useless Anonymous Fns [[no-useless-anonymous-fns]]

Don't wrap functions in anonymous functions when you don't need to.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(filter even? (range 1 10))

;; bad
(filter #(even? %) (range 1 10))
----

=== No Multiple Forms Fn Literals [[no-multiple-forms-fn-literals]]

Don't use function literals if the function body will consist of
more than one form.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(fn [x]
  (println x)
  (* x 2))

;; bad (you need an explicit do form)
#(do (println %)
     (* % 2))
----

=== `complement` [[complement]]

Favor the use of `complement` versus the use of an anonymous function.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(filter (complement some-pred?) coll)

;; bad
(filter #(not (some-pred? %)) coll)
----

This rule should obviously be ignored if the complementing predicate 
exists in the form of a separate function (e.g. `even?` and `odd?`).

=== `comp` [[comp]]

Favor `comp` over anonymous functions for function composition.

[source,clojure]
----
;; Assuming `(:require [clojure.string :as str])`...

;; good
(map #(str/capitalize (str/trim %)) ["top " " test "])

;; better
(map (comp str/capitalize str/trim) ["top " " test "])
----

=== `partial` [[partial]]

Favor `partial` over anonymous functions for currying.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(map #(+ 5 %) (range 1 10))

;; (arguably) better
(map (partial + 5) (range 1 10))
----

=== Threading Macros [[threading-macros]]

Prefer the use of the threading macros `+->+` (thread-first) and `+->>+`
(thread-last) to heavy form nesting.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(-> [1 2 3]
    reverse
    (conj 4)
    prn)

;; not as good
(prn (conj (reverse [1 2 3])
           4))

;; good
(->> (range 1 10)
     (filter even?)
     (map (partial * 2)))

;; not as good
(map (partial * 2)
     (filter even? (range 1 10)))
----

=== Default `cond` Branch [[else-keyword-in-cond]]

Use `:else` as the catch-all test expression in `cond`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(cond
  (neg? n) "negative"
  (pos? n) "positive"
  :else "zero")

;; bad
(cond
  (neg? n) "negative"
  (pos? n) "positive"
  true "zero")
----

=== `condp` vs `cond` [[condp]]

Prefer `condp` instead of `cond` when the predicate & expression don't
change.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(cond
  (= x 10) :ten
  (= x 20) :twenty
  (= x 30) :thirty
  :else :dunno)

;; much better
(condp = x
  10 :ten
  20 :twenty
  30 :thirty
  :dunno)
----

=== `case` vs `cond/condp` [[case]]

Prefer `case` instead of `cond` or `condp` when test expressions are
compile-time constants.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(cond
  (= x 10) :ten
  (= x 20) :twenty
  (= x 30) :forty
  :else :dunno)

;; better
(condp = x
  10 :ten
  20 :twenty
  30 :forty
  :dunno)

;; best
(case x
  10 :ten
  20 :twenty
  30 :forty
  :dunno)
----

=== Short Forms In Cond [[short-forms-in-cond]]

Use short forms in `cond` and related.  If not possible give visual
hints for the pairwise grouping with comments or empty lines.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(cond
  (test1) (action1)
  (test2) (action2)
  :else   (default-action))

;; ok-ish
(cond
  ;; test case 1
  (test1)
  (long-function-name-which-requires-a-new-line
    (complicated-sub-form
      (-> 'which-spans multiple-lines)))

  ;; test case 2
  (test2)
  (another-very-long-function-name
    (yet-another-sub-form
      (-> 'which-spans multiple-lines)))

  :else
  (the-fall-through-default-case
    (which-also-spans 'multiple
                      'lines)))
----

=== Set As Predicate [[set-as-predicate]]

Use a `set` as a predicate when appropriate.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(remove #{1} [0 1 2 3 4 5])

;; bad
(remove #(= % 1) [0 1 2 3 4 5])

;; good
(count (filter #{\a \e \i \o \u} "mary had a little lamb"))

                    (= % \o)
                    (= % \u))
               "mary had a little lamb"))
----

=== `inc` and `dec` [[inc-and-dec]]

Use `(inc x)` & `(dec x)` instead of `(+ x 1)` and `(- x 1)`.

=== `pos?` and `neg?` [[pos-and-neg]]

Use `(pos? x)`, `(neg? x)` & `(zero? x)` instead of `(> x 0)`,
`(< x 0)` & `(= x 0)`.

=== `list*` vs `cons` [[list-star-instead-of-nested-cons]]

Use `list*` instead of a series of nested `cons` invocations.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(list* 1 2 3 [4 5])

;; bad
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 [4 5])))
----

=== Sugared Java Interop [[sugared-java-interop]]

Use the sugared Java interop forms.

[source,clojure]
----
;;; object creation
;; good
(java.util.ArrayList. 100)

;; bad
(new java.util.ArrayList 100)

;;; static method invocation
;; good
(Math/pow 2 10)

(. Integer MAX_VALUE)

;;; instance field access
;; good
(.someField some-object)

;; bad

----

=== Compact Metadata Notation For True Flags [[compact-metadata-notation-for-true-flags]]

Use the compact metadata notation for metadata that contains only
slots whose keys are keywords and whose value is boolean `true`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def ^:private a 5)

;; bad
(def ^{:private true} a 5)
----

=== Private [[private]]

Denote private parts of your code.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn- private-fun [] ...)

(def ^:private private-var ...)

;; bad
(defn private-fun [] ...) ; not private at all

(defn ^:private private-fun [] ...) ; overly verbose

(def private-var ...) ; not private at all
----

=== Access Private Var [[access-private-var]]

To access a private var (e.g. for testing), use the `@#'some.ns/var` form.

=== Attach Metadata Carefully [[attach-metadata-carefully]]

Be careful regarding what exactly you attach metadata to.

[source,clojure]
----
;; we attach the metadata to the var referenced by `a`
(def ^:private a {})
(meta a) ;=> nil
(meta #'a) ;=> {:private true}

;; we attach the metadata to the empty hash-map value
(def a ^:private {})
(meta a) ;=> {:private true}
(meta #'a) ;=> nil
----

== Naming

[quote, Phil Karlton]
____
The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
naming things.
____

=== Ns Naming Schemas [[ns-naming-schemas]]

When naming namespaces favor the following two schemas:

* `project.module`
* `organization.project.module`

=== Lisp Case Ns [[lisp-case-ns]]

Use `lisp-case` in composite namespace segments (e.g. `bruce.project-euler`).

=== Lisp Case [[lisp-case]]

Use `lisp-case` for function and variable names.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def some-var ...)
(defn some-fun ...)

;; bad
(def someVar ...)
(defn somefun ...)
(def some_fun ...)
----

=== Camelcase For Protocols Records Structs And Types [[CamelCase-for-protocols-records-structs-and-types]]

Use `CamelCase` for protocols, records, structs, and types. (Keep
acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase.)

=== Pred With Question Mark [[pred-with-question-mark]]

The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
should end in a question mark
(e.g., `even?`).

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn palindrome? ...)

;; bad
(defn palindrome-p ...) ; Common Lisp style
(defn is-palindrome ...) ; Java style
----

=== Changing State Fns With Exclamation Mark [[changing-state-fns-with-exclamation-mark]]

The names of functions/macros that are not safe in STM transactions
should end with an exclamation mark (e.g. `reset!`).

=== Arrow Instead Of To [[arrow-instead-of-to]]

Use `+->+` instead of `to` in the names of conversion functions.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn f->c ...)

;; not so good
(defn f-to-c ...)
----

=== Earmuffs For Dynamic Vars [[earmuffs-for-dynamic-vars]]

Use `*earmuffs*` for things intended for rebinding (ie. are dynamic).

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def ^:dynamic *a* 10)

;; bad
(def ^:dynamic a 10)
----

=== Don't Flag Constants [[dont-flag-constants]]

Don't use a special notation for constants; everything is assumed a constant
unless specified otherwise.

=== Underscore For Unused Bindings [[underscore-for-unused-bindings]]

Use `+_+` for destructuring targets and formal argument names whose
value will be ignored by the code at hand. 

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(let [[a b _ c] [1 2 3 4]]
  (println a b c))

(dotimes [_ 3]
  (println "Hello!"))

;; bad
(let [[a b c d] [1 2 3 4]]
  (println a b d))

(dotimes [i 3]
  (println "Hello!"))
----

However, when it can help the understanding of your code, it can be useful to explicitly name unused arguments or maps you're destructuring from. In this case, prepend the name with an underscore to explicitly signal that the variable is supposed to be unused.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn myfun1 [context _]
 (assoc context :foo "bar"))
 
(defn myfun2 [context {:keys [id]}]
 (assoc context :user-id id))

;; better
(defn myfun1 [context _user]
 (assoc context :foo "bar"))

(defn myfun2 [context {:keys [id] :as _user}]
 (assoc context :user-id id))
----

=== Idiomatic Names [[idiomatic-names]]

Follow ``clojure.core``'s example for idiomatic names like `pred` and `coll`.

* in functions:
 ** `f`, `g`, `h` - function input
 ** `n` - integer input usually a size
 ** `index`, `i` - integer index
 ** `x`, `y` - numbers
 ** `xs` - sequence
 ** `m` - map
 ** `s` - string input
 ** `re` - regular expression
 ** `coll` - a collection
 ** `pred` - a predicate closure
 ** `& more` - variadic input
 ** `xf` - xform, a transducer
* in macros:
 ** `expr` - an expression
 ** `body` - a macro body
 ** `binding` - a macro binding vector

== Data Structures

[quote, Alan J. Perlis]
____
It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure
than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.
____

=== Avoid Lists [[avoid-lists]]

Avoid the use of lists for generic data storage (unless a list is
exactly what you need).

=== Keywords For Hash Keys [[keywords-for-hash-keys]]

Prefer the use of keywords for hash keys.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
{:name "Bruce" :age 30}

;; bad
{"name" "Bruce" "age" 30}
----

=== Literal Col Syntax [[literal-col-syntax]]

Prefer the use of the literal collection syntax where
applicable. However, when defining sets, only use literal syntax
when the values are compile-time constants.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
[1 2 3]
#{1 2 3}
(hash-set (func1) (func2)) ; values determined at runtime

;; bad
(vector 1 2 3)
(hash-set 1 2 3)
#{(func1) (func2)} ; will throw runtime exception if (func1) = (func2)
----

=== Avoid Index Based Coll Access [[avoid-index-based-coll-access]]

Avoid accessing collection members by index whenever possible.

=== Keywords As Fn To Get Map Values [[keywords-as-fn-to-get-map-values]]

Prefer the use of keywords as functions for retrieving values from
maps, where applicable.

[source,clojure]
----
(def m {:name "Bruce" :age 30})

;; good
(:name m)

;; more verbose than necessary
(get m :name)

;; bad - susceptible to NullPointerException
(m :name)
----

=== Colls As Fns [[colls-as-fns]]

Leverage the fact that most collections are functions of their elements.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(filter #{\a \e \o \i \u} "this is a test")

;; bad - too ugly to share
----

=== Keywords As Fns [[keywords-as-fns]]

Leverage the fact that keywords can be used as functions of a collection.

[source,clojure]
----
((juxt :a :b) {:a "ala" :b "bala"})
----

=== Avoid Transient Colls [[avoid-transient-colls]]

Avoid the use of transient collections, except for
performance-critical portions of the code.

=== Avoid Java Colls [[avoid-java-colls]]

Avoid the use of Java collections.

=== Avoid Java Arrays [[avoid-java-arrays]]

Avoid the use of Java arrays, except for interop scenarios and
performance-critical code dealing heavily with primitive types.

== Types & Records

=== Record Constructors [[record-constructors]]

Don't use the interop syntax to
construct type and record instances.  `deftype` and `defrecord`
automatically create constructor functions. Use those instead of
the interop syntax, as they make it clear that you're dealing with a
`deftype` or a `defrecord`. See https://stuartsierra.com/2015/05/17/clojure-record-constructors[this
article]
for more details.

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord Foo [a b])
(deftype Bar [a b])

;; good
(->Foo 1 2)
(map->Foo {:b 4 :a 3})
(->Bar 1 2)

;; bad
(Foo. 1 2)
(Bar. 1 2)
----

Note that `deftype` doesn't define the `+map->Type+`
  constructor. It's available only for records.

=== Custom Record Constructors [[custom-record-constructors]]

Add custom type/record constructors when needed (e.g. to validate
properties on record creation). See https://stuartsierra.com/2015/05/17/clojure-record-constructors[this
article]
for more details.

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord Customer [id name phone email])

(defn make-customer
  "Creates a new customer record."
  [{:keys [name phone email]}]
  {:pre [(string? name)
         (valid-phone? phone)
         (valid-email? email)]}
  (->Customer (next-id) name phone email))
----

Feel free to adopt whatever naming convention or structure you'd like for such custom constructors.

=== Custom Record Constructors Naming [[custom-record-constructors-naming]]

Don't override the auto-generated type/record constructor functions.
People expect them to have a certain behaviour and changing this behaviour
violates the principle of least surprise. See https://stuartsierra.com/2015/05/17/clojure-record-constructors[this 
article]
for more details.

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord Foo [num])

;; good
(defn make-foo
  [num]
  {:pre [(pos? num)]}
  (->Foo num))

;; bad
(defn ->Foo
  [num]
  {:pre [(pos? num)]}
  (Foo. num))
----

== Mutation

=== Refs [[Refs]]

==== `io!` Macro [[refs-io-macro]]

Consider wrapping all I/O calls with the `io!` macro to avoid nasty
surprises if you accidentally end up calling such code in a
transaction.

==== Avoid `ref-set` [[refs-avoid-ref-set]]

Avoid the use of `ref-set` whenever possible.

[source,clojure]
----
(def r (ref 0))

;; good
(dosync (alter r + 5))

;; bad
(dosync (ref-set r 5))
----

==== Small Transactions [[refs-small-transactions]]

Try to keep the size of transactions (the amount of work encapsulated in them)
as small as possible.

==== Avoid Short Long Transactions With Same Ref [[refs-avoid-short-long-transactions-with-same-ref]]

Avoid having both short- and long-running transactions interacting
with the same Ref.

=== Agents [[Agents]]

==== Agents Send [[agents-send]]

Use `send` only for actions that are CPU bound and don't block on I/O
or other threads.

==== Agents Send Off [[agents-send-off]]

Use `send-off` for actions that might block, sleep, or otherwise tie
up the thread.

=== Atoms [[Atoms]]

==== No Updates Within Transactions [[atoms-no-update-within-transactions]]

Avoid atom updates inside STM transactions.

==== Prefer `swap!` over `reset!` [[atoms-prefer-swap-over-reset]]

Try to use `swap!` rather than `reset!`, where possible.

[source,clojure]
----
(def a (atom 0))

;; good
(swap! a + 5)

;; not as good
(reset! a 5)
----

== Strings

=== Prefer Clojure String Over Interop [[prefer-clojure-string-over-interop]]

Prefer string manipulation functions from `clojure.string` over Java interop or rolling your own.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(clojure.string/upper-case "bruce")

;; bad
(.toUpperCase "bruce")
----

== Exceptions

=== Reuse Existing Exception Types [[reuse-existing-exception-types]]

Reuse existing exception types. Idiomatic Clojure code -- when it does
throw an exception -- throws an exception of a standard type
(e.g. `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`,
`java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`,
`java.lang.IllegalStateException`, `java.io.IOException`).

=== Prefer `with-open` Over `finally` [[prefer-with-open-over-finally]]

Favor `with-open` over `finally`.

== Macros

=== Don't Write Macro If Fn Will Do [[dont-write-macro-if-fn-will-do]]

Don't write a macro if a function will do.

=== Write Macro Usage Before Writing The Macro [[write-macro-usage-before-writing-the-macro]]

Create an example of a macro usage first and the macro afterwards.

=== Break Complicated Macros [[break-complicated-macros]]

Break complicated macros into smaller functions whenever possible.

=== Macros As Syntactic Sugar [[macros-as-syntactic-sugar]]

A macro should usually just provide syntactic sugar and the core of
the macro should be a plain function. Doing so will improve
composability.

=== Syntax Quoted Forms [[syntax-quoted-forms]]

Prefer syntax-quoted forms over building lists manually.

== Comments

[quote, Steve McConnell]
____
Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this
comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make
it even clearer.
____

=== Self Documenting Code [[self-documenting-code]]

Endeavor to make your code as self-documenting as possible.

=== Four Semicolons For Heading Comments [[four-semicolons-for-heading-comments]]

Write heading comments with at least four semicolons.

=== Three Semicolons For Top Level Comments [[three-semicolons-for-top-level-comments]]

Write top-level comments with three semicolons.

=== Two Semicolons For Code Fragment [[two-semicolons-for-code-fragment]]

Write comments on a particular fragment of code before that fragment
and aligned with it, using two semicolons.

=== One Semicolon For Margin Comments [[one-semicolon-for-margin-comments]]

Write margin comments with one semicolon.

=== Semicolon Space [[semicolon-space]]

Always have at least one space between the semicolon
and the text that follows it.

----

=== English Syntax [[english-syntax]]

Comments longer than a word begin with a capital letter and use
punctuation. Separate sentences with
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing[one space].

=== No Superfluous Comments [[no-superfluous-comments]]

Avoid superfluous comments.

[source,clojure]
----
;; bad
(inc counter) ; increments counter by one
----

=== Comment Upkeep [[comment-upkeep]]

Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
at all.

=== Dash Underscore Reader Macro [[dash-underscore-reader-macro]]

Prefer the use of the `#_` reader macro over a regular comment when
you need to comment out a particular form.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(+ foo #_(bar x) delta)

;; bad
(+ foo
   ;; (bar x)
   delta)
----

=== Refactor Don't Comment [[refactor-dont-comment]]

[quote, Russ Olsen]
____
Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation.
____

Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
make it self-explanatory. ("Do, or do not. There is no try." --Yoda)

=== Comment Annotations

==== Annotate Above [[annotate-above]]

Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
the relevant code.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME: Replace baz with the newer bar.
  (baz))

;; bad
;; FIXME: Replace baz with the newer bar.
(defn some-fun
  []
  (baz))
----

==== Annotate Keywords [[annotate-keywords]]

The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
describing the problem.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME: Replace baz with the newer bar.
  (baz))

;; bad - no colon after annotation
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME Replace baz with the newer bar.
  (baz))

;; bad - no space after colon
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME:Replace baz with the newer bar.
  (baz))
----

==== Indent Annotations [[indent-annotations]]

If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
lines should be indented as much as the first one.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v1.2.3. It may
  ;;        be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade. (xz 13-1-31)
  (baz))

;; bad
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v1.2.3. It may
  ;; be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade. (xz 13-1-31)
  (baz))
----

==== Sign And Date Annotations [[sign-and-date-annotations]]

Tag the annotation with your initials and a date so its relevance can
be easily verified.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn some-fun
  []
  ;; FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v1.2.3. It may
  ;;        be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade. (xz 13-1-31)
  (baz))
----

==== Rare Eol Annotations [[rare-eol-annotations]]

In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn bar
  []
  (sleep 100)) ; OPTIMIZE
----

==== `TODO` [[todo]]

Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
added at a later date.

==== `FIXME` [[fixme]]

Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.

==== `OPTIMIZE` [[optimize]]

Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause
performance problems.

==== `HACK` [[hack]]

Use `HACK` to note "code smells" where questionable coding practices
were used and should be refactored away.

==== `REVIEW` [[review]]

Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it
is working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the
client does X currently?`

==== Document Custom Annotations [[document-annotations]]

Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be
sure to document them in your project's `README` or similar.

== Documentation

Docstrings are the primary way to document Clojure code. Many definition forms
(e.g. `def`, `defn`, `defmacro`, `ns`)
support docstrings and usually it's a good idea to make good use of them, regardless
of whether the var in question is something public or private.

If a definition form doesn't support docstrings directly you can still supply them via
the `:doc` metadata attribute.

This section outlines some of the common conventions and best
practices for documenting Clojure code.

=== Prefer Docstrings [[prefer-docstrings]]

If a form supports docstrings directly prefer them over using `:doc` metadata:

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo
  "This function doesn't do much."
  []
  ...)

(ns foo.bar.core
  "That's an awesome library.")

;; bad
(defn foo
  ^{:doc "This function doesn't do much."}
  []
  ...)

(ns ^{:doc "That's an awesome library.")
  foo.bar.core)
----

=== Docstring Summary [[docstring-summary]]

Let the first line in the docstring be a complete, capitalized
sentence which concisely describes the var in question. This makes it
easy for tooling (Clojure editors and IDEs) to display a short a summary of
the docstring at various places.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn frobnitz
  "This function does a frobnitz.
  It will do gnorwatz to achieve this, but only under certain
  circumstances."
  []
  ...)

;; bad
(defn frobnitz
  "This function does a frobnitz. It will do gnorwatz to
  achieve this, but only under certain circumstances."
  []
  ...)
----

=== Leverage Markdown in Docstrings [[markdown-docstrings]]

Important tools such as https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/blob/master/doc/userguide/for-library-authors.adoc#docstrings[cljdoc] support Markdown in docstrings so leverage it for nicely formatted documentation.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn qzuf-number
  "Computes the [Qzuf number](https://wikipedia.org/qzuf) of the `coll`.
  Supported options in `opts`:
  
  | key           | description |
  | --------------|-------------|
  | `:finite-uni?`| Assume finite universe; default: `false`
  | `:complex?`   | If OK to return a [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number); default: `false`
  | `:timeout`    | Throw an exception if the computation doesn't finish within `:timeout` milliseconds; default: `nil`
  
  Example:
  ```clojure
  (when (neg? (qzuf-number [1 2 3] {:finite-uni? true})) 
    (throw (RuntimeException. "Error in the Universe!")))
  ```"
  [coll opts]
  ...)
----

=== Document Pos Arguments [[document-pos-arguments]]

Document all positional arguments, and wrap them them with backticks
(`) so that editors and IDEs can identify them and potentially provide extra
functionality for them.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn watsitz
  "Watsitz takes a `frob` and converts it to a znoot.
  When the `frob` is negative, the znoot becomes angry."
  [frob]
  ...)

;; bad
(defn watsitz
  "Watsitz takes a frob and converts it to a znoot.
  When the frob is negative, the znoot becomes angry."
  [frob]
  ...)
----

=== Document References [[document-references]]

Wrap any var references in the docstring with ` so that tooling
can identify them. Wrap them with `[[..]]` if you want to link to them.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn wombat
  "Acts much like `clojure.core/identity` except when it doesn't.
  Takes `x` as an argument and returns that. If it feels like it.
  See also [[kangaroo]]."
  [x]
  ...)

;; bad
(defn wombat
  "Acts much like clojure.core/identity except when it doesn't.
  Takes `x` as an argument and returns that. If it feels like it.
  See also kangaroo."
  [x]
  ...)
----

=== Docstring Grammar [[docstring-grammar]]

Docstrings should be composed of well-formed English sentences. Every sentence 
should start with a capitalized word, be gramatically coherent, and end 
with appropriate punctuation. Sentences should be separated with a single space.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def foo
  "All sentences should end with a period (or maybe an exclamation mark).
  The sentence should be followed by a space, unless it concludes the docstring.")

;; bad
(def foo
  "all sentences should end with a period (or maybe an exclamation mark).
  The sentence should be followed by a space, unless it concludes the docstring.")
----

=== Docstring Indentation [[docstring-indentation]]

Indent multi-line docstrings by two spaces.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(ns my.ns
  "It is actually possible to document a ns.
  It's a nice place to describe the purpose of the namespace and maybe even
  the overall conventions used. Note how _not_ indenting the docstring makes
  it easier for tooling to display it correctly.")

;; bad
(ns my.ns
  "It is actually possible to document a ns.
It's a nice place to describe the purpose of the namespace and maybe even
the overall conventions used. Note how _not_ indenting the docstring makes
it easier for tooling to display it correctly.")
----

=== Docstring Leading Trailing Whitespace [[docstring-leading-trailing-whitespace]]

Neither start nor end your docstrings with any whitespace.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(def foo
  "I'm so awesome."
  42)

;; bad
(def silly
  "    It's just silly to start a docstring with spaces.
  Just as silly as it is to end it with a bunch of them.      "
  42)
----

=== Docstring After Fn Name [[docstring-after-fn-name]]

When adding a docstring -- especially to a function using the above form -- take
care to correctly place the docstring after the function name, not after the
argument vector.  The latter is not invalid syntax and won't cause an error,
but includes the string as a form in the function body without attaching it to
the var as documentation.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(defn foo
  "docstring"
  [x]
  (bar x))

;; bad
(defn foo [x]
  "docstring"
  (bar x))
----

== Existential

=== Be Functional [[be-functional]]

Code in a functional way, using mutation only when it makes sense.

=== Be Consistent [[be-consistent]]

Be consistent. In an ideal world, be consistent with these guidelines.

=== Common Sense [[common-sense]]

Use common sense.

== Testing

=== Test Directory Structure [[test-directory-structure]]

Store your tests in a separate directory, typically `test/yourproject/` (as
opposed to `src/yourproject/`). Your build tool is responsible for making
them available in the contexts where they are necessary; most templates
will do this for you automatically.

=== Test Ns Naming [[test-ns-naming]]

Name your ns `yourproject.something-test`, a file which usually lives in
`test/yourproject/something_test.clj` (or `.cljc`, `cljs`).

=== Test Naming [[test-naming]]

When using `clojure.test`, define your tests
with `deftest` and name them `something-test`.

[source,clojure]
----
;; good
(deftest something-test ...)

;; bad
(deftest something-tests ...)
(deftest test-something ...)
(deftest something ...)
----

== Library Organization

=== Coordinates [[lib-coordinates]]

If you are publishing libraries to be used by others, make sure to
follow the https://central.sonatype.org/pages/choosing-your-coordinates.html[Central Repository
guidelines]
for choosing your `groupId` and `artifactId`. This helps to prevent
name conflicts and facilitates the widest possible use. A good
example is https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[Component].

=== Minimize Dependencies [[lib-min-dependencies]]

Avoid unnecessary dependencies. For example, a three-line utility
function copied into a project is usually better than a dependency
that drags in hundreds of vars you do not plan to use.

=== Tool-agnostic [[lib-core-separate-from-tools]]

Deliver core functionality and integration points in separate
artifacts.  That way, consumers can consume your library without
being constrained by your unrelated tooling preferences. For example,
https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[Component] provides
core functionality, and
https://github.com/stuartsierra/reloaded[reloaded] provides leiningen
integration.

== Lint Tools

There are some lint tools created by the Clojure community that might aid you
in your endeavor to write idiomatic Clojure code.

* https://github.com/technomancy/slamhound[Slamhound] is a tool that will
automatically generate proper `ns` declarations from your existing code.
* https://github.com/jonase/kibit[kibit] is a static code analyzer for
Clojure which uses https://github.com/clojure/core.logic[core.logic] to
search for patterns of code for which there might exist a more idiomatic
function or macro.
* https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo] is a linter that detects
a wide number of discouraged patterns and suggests improvements based on this
style guide

== Contributing

Nothing written in this guide is set in stone. It's my desire to work
together with everyone interested in Clojure coding style, so that we could
ultimately create a resource that will be beneficial to the entire Clojure
community.

Feel free to [open tickets or send pull requests](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide/issues) with improvements. Thanks in
advance for your help!

You can also support the style guide (and all my Clojure projects like
CIDER, nREPL, orchard, etc) with financial contributions via

== Spread the Word

A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that
doesn't know about its existence. Tweet about the guide, share it with
your friends and colleagues. Every comment, suggestion or opinion we
get makes the guide just a little bit better. And we want to have the
best possible guide, don't we?
