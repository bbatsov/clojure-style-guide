# The Clojure Style Guide

This Clojure style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Clojure
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Clojure
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted I've
assumed that is pretty obvious).

I didn't come up with all the rules out of nowhere - they are mostly
based on my extensive career as a professional software engineer,
feedback and suggestions from members of the Clojure community, and
various highly regarded Clojure programming resources, such as
["Clojure Programming"](http://www.clojurebook.com/)
and ["The Joy of Clojure"](http://joyofclojure.com/).

The guide is still a work in progress - some sections are missing,
others are incomplete, some rules are lacking examples, some rules
don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough. In due time
these issues will be addressed - just keep them in mind for now.

## Source Code Layout & Organization

> Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
> ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
> probably right... <br/>
> -- Jerry Coffin (on indentation)

* Use two **spaces** per indentation level. No hard tabs.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (when something
      (something-else))

    ;; bad - four spaces
    (when something
        (something-else))
    ```

* Align vertically function arguments.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (filter even?
            (range 1 10))

    ;; bad
    (filter even?
      (range 1 10))
    ```

* Align `let` bindings and map keywords.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (let [thing1 "some stuff"
          thing2 "other stuff"]
      {:thing1 thing1
       :thing2 thing2})

    ;; bad
    (let [thing1 "some stuff"
      thing2 "other stuff"]
      {:thing1 thing1
      :thing2 thing2})
    ```

* Optionally omit the new line between the function name and argument vector for `defn` when there is no docstring.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn foo
      [x]
      (bar x))

    ;; good
    (defn foo [x]
      (bar x))

    ;; bad
    (defn foo
      [x] (bar x))
    ```

* Optionally omit the new line between the argument vector and a short function body.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn foo [x]
      (bar x))

    ;; good for a small function body
    (defn goo [x] (bar x))

    ;; good for multi-arity functions
    (defn foo
      ([x] (bar x))
      ([x y]
        (if (predicate? x)
          (bar x)
          (baz x))))

    ;; bad
    (defn foo
      [x] (if (predicate? x)
            (bar x)
            (baz x)))
    ```

* Indent each line of multi-line docstrings.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn foo
      "Hello there. This is
      a multi-line docstring."
      []
      (bar))

    ;; bad
    (defn foo
      "Hello there. This is
    a multi-line docstring."
      []
      (bar))
    ```

* Use Unix-style line endings. (*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by default,
  Windows users have to be extra careful.)
    * If you're using Git you might want to add the following
    configuration setting to protect your project from Windows line
    endings creeping in:

        ```bash
        $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
        ```

* If any text precedes an opening bracket(`(`, `{` and
`[`) or follows a closing bracket(`)`, `}` and `]`), separate that
text from that bracket with a space. Conversely, leave no space after
an opening bracket and before following text, or after preceding text
and before a closing bracket.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (foo (bar baz) quux)

    ;; bad
    (foo(bar baz)quux)
    (foo ( bar baz ) quux)
    ```

* Don't use commas between the elements of sequential collection literals.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    [1 2 3]
    (1 2 3)

    ;; bad
    [1, 2, 3]
    (1, 2, 3)
    ```

* Consider enhancing the readability of map literals via judicious use
of commas and line breaks.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    {:name "Bruce Wayne" :alter-ego "Batman"}

    ;; good and arguably a bit more readable
    {:name "Bruce Wayne"
     :alter-ego "Batman"}

    ;; good and arguably more compact
    {:name "Bruce Wayne", :alter-ego "Batman"}
    ```

* Place all trailing parentheses on a single line.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (when something
      (something-else))

    ;; bad
    (when something
      (something-else)
    )
    ```

* Use empty lines between top level forms.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (def x ...)

    (defn foo ...)

    ;; bad
    (def x ...)
    (defn foo ...)
    ```

* Do not place blank lines in the middle of a function or
macro definition.
* Where feasible, avoid making lines longer than 80 characters.
* Avoid trailing whitespace.
* Use one file per namespace.
* Start every namespace with a comprehensive `ns` form, comprised of `import`s, `require`s, `refer`s and `use`s.

    ```Clojure
    (ns examples.ns
      (:refer-clojure :exclude [next replace remove])
      (:require (clojure [string :as string]
                         [set :as set])
                [clojure.java.shell :as sh])
      (:use (clojure zip xml))
      (:import java.util.Date
               java.text.SimpleDateFormat
               (java.util.concurrent Executors
                                     LinkedBlockingQueue)))
    ```

* Avoid single-segment namespaces.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (ns example.ns)

    ;; bad
    (ns example)
    ```

* Avoid the use of overly long namespaces(i.e. with more than 5 segments).

* Avoid functions longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most
  functions will be shorter than 5 LOC.

* Avoid parameter lists with more than three or four positional parameters.

## Syntax

* Avoid the use of namespace-manipulating functions like `require` and
  `refer`. They are entirely unnecessary outside of a REPL
  environment.
* Use `declare` to enable forward references.
* Prefer higher-order functions like `map` to `loop/recur`.

* Prefer function pre and post conditions to checks inside a function's body.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn foo [x]
      {:pre [(pos? x)]}
      (bar x))

    ;; bad
    (defn foo [x]
      (if (pos? x)
        (bar x)
        (throw (IllegalArgumentException "x must be a positive number!")))
    ```

* Don't define vars inside functions.

    ```Clojure
    ;; very bad
    (defn foo []
      (def x 5)
      ...)
    ```

* Don't shadow `clojure.core` names with local bindings.

    ```Clojure
    ;; bad - you're forced to used clojure.core/map fully qualified inside
    (defn foo [map]
      ...)
    ```

* Use `seq` as a terminating condition to test whether a sequence is
  empty (this technique is sometimes called *nil punning*).

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn print-seq [s]
      (when (seq s)
        (prn (first s))
        (recur (rest s))))

    ;; bad
    (defn print-seq [s]
      (when-not (empty? s)
        (prn (first s))
        (recur (rest s))))
    ```

* Use `when` instead of `(if ... (do ...)`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (when pred
      (foo)
      (bar))

    ;; bad
    (if pred
      (do
        (foo)
        (bar)))
    ```

* Use `if-let` instead of `let` + `if`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (if-let [result :foo]
      (something-with result)
      (something-else))

    ;; bad
    (let [result :foo]
      (if result
        (something-with result)
        (something-else)))
    ```

* Use `when-let` instead of `let` + `when`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (when-let [result :foo]
      (do-something-with result)
      (do-something-more-with result))

    ;; bad
    (let [result :foo]
      (when result
        (do-something-with result)
        (do-something-more-with result)))
    ```

* Use `if-not` instead of `(if (not ...) ...)`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (if-not (pred)
      (foo))

    ;; bad
    (if (not pred)
      (foo))
    ```

* Use `when-not` instead of `(when (not ...) ...)`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (when-not pred
      (foo)
      (bar))

    ;; bad
    (when (not pred)
      (foo)
      (bar))
    ```

* Use `not=` instead of `(not (= ...))`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (not= foo bar)

    ;; bad
    (not (= foo bar))
    ```

* Prefer `%` over `%1` in function literals with only one parameter.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    #(Math/round %)

    ;; bad
    #(Math/round %1)
    ```

* Prefer `%1` over `%` in function literals with more than one parameter.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    #(Math/pow %1 %2)

    ;; bad
    #(Math/pow % %2)
    ```

* Don't wrap functions in anonymous functions when you don't need to.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (filter even? (range 1 10))

    ;; bad
    (filter #(even? %) (range 1 10))
    ```

* Don't use function literals if the function body will consist of more than one form.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (fn [x]
      (println x)
      (* x 2))

    ;; bad (you need an explicit do form)
    #(do (println %)
         (* % 2))
    ```

* Favor the use of `complement` versus the use of an anonymous function.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (filter (complement some-pred?) coll)

    ;; bad
    (filter #(not (some-pred? %)) coll)
    ```

    This rule should obviously be ignored if the complementing predicate
    exists in the form of a separate function (e.g. `even?` and `odd?`).

* Leverage `comp` when it would yield simpler code.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (map #(capitalize (trim %)) ["top " " test "])

    ;; better
    (map (comp capitalize trim) ["top " " test "])
    ```

* Leverage `partial` when it would yield simpler code.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (map #(+ 5 %) (range 1 10))

    ;; (arguably) better
    (map (partial + 5) (range 1 10))
    ```

* Prefer the use of the threading macros `->` (thread-first) and `->>` (thread-last)
to heavy form nesting.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (-> [1 2 3]
        reverse
        (conj 4)
        prn)

    ;; not as good
    (prn (conj (reverse [1 2 3])
               4))

    ;; good
    (->> (range 1 10)
         (filter even?)
         (map (partial * 2)))

    ;; not as good
    (map (partial * 2)
         (filter even? (range 1 10)))
    ```

* Prefer `..` to `->` when chaining method calls in Java interop.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (-> (System/getProperties) (.get "os.name"))

    ;; better
    (.. System getProperties (get "os.name"))
    ```

* Use `:else` as the catch-all test expression in `cond` and `condp`.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (cond
      (< n 0) "negative"
      (> n 0) "positive"
      :else "zero"))

    ;; bad
    (cond
      (< n 0) "negative"
      (> n 0) "positive"
      true "zero"))
    ```

* Prefer `condp` instead of `cond` when the predicate & expression don't
  change.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (cond
      (= x 10) :ten
      (= x 20) :twenty
      (= x 30) :forty
      :else :dunno)

    ;; much better
    (condp = x
      10 :ten
      20 :twenty
      30 :forty
      :dunno)
    ```

* Prefer `case` instead of `cond` or `condp` when test expressions are
compile time constants.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (cond
      (= x 10) :ten
      (= x 20) :twenty
      (= x 30) :forty
      :else :dunno)

    ;; better
    (condp = x
      10 :ten
      20 :twenty
      30 :forty
      :dunno)

    ;; best
    (case x
      10 :ten
      20 :twenty
      30 :forty
      :dunno)
    ```

* Use a `set` as a predicate when appropriate.

    ```Clojure
    ;; bad
    (remove #(= % 0) [0 1 2 3 4 5])

    ;; good
    (remove #{0} [0 1 2 3 4 5])

    ;; bad
    (count (filter #(or (= % \a)
                        (= % \e)
                        (= % \i)
                        (= % \o)
                        (= % \u))
                   "mary had a little lamb"))

    ;; good
    (count (filter #{\a \e \i \o \u} "mary had a little lamb"))
    ```

* Use `(inc x)` & `(dec x)` instead of `(+ x 1)` and `(- x 1)`.

* Use `(pos? x)`, `(neg? x)` & `(zero? x)` instead of `(> x 0)`,
`(< x 0)` & `(= x 0)`.

* Use the sugared Java interop forms.

    ```Clojure
    ;;; object creation
    ;; good
    (java.util.ArrayList. 100)

    ;; bad
    (new java.util.ArrayList 100)

    ;;; static method invocation
    ;; good
    (Math/pow 2 10)

    ;; bad
    (. Math pow 2 10)

    ;;; instance method invocation
    ;; good
    (.substring "hello" 1 3)

    ;; bad
    (. "hello" substring 1 3)

    ;;; static field access
    ;; good
    Integer/MAX_VALUE

    ;; bad
    (. Integer MAX_VALUE)

    ;;; instance field access
    ;; good
    (.someField some-object)

    ;; bad
    (. some-object some-field)
    ```

## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* When naming namespaces favor the following two schemas:
    * `project.module`
    * `organization.project.module`
* Use `lisp-case` in composite namespace segments(e.g. `bruce.project-euler`)
* Use `lisp-case` for function and variable names.
* Use `CamelCase` for protocols, records, structs and types. (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `even?`).
* The names of functions/macros that are not safe in STM transactions
  should end with an exclamation mark. (i.e. `reset!`)
* Use `->` instead of `to` in the names of conversion functions.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (defn f->c ...)

    ;; not so good
    (defn f-to-c ...)
    ```

* Use `*earmuffs*` for things intended for rebinding (ie. are dynamic).
* Don't use a special notation for constants; everything is assumed a constant
  unless specified otherwise.
* Use `_` for destructuring targets and formal arguments names whose
  value will be ignored by the code at hand.
* Follow `clojure.core`'s example for idiomatic names like `pred` and `coll`.
    * in functions:
        * `f`, `g`, `h` - function input
        * `n` - integer input usually a size
        * `index` - integer index
        * `x`, `y` - numbers
        * `s` - string input
        * `coll` - a collection
        * `pred` - a predicate closure
        * `& more` - variadic input
    * in macros:
        * `expr` - an expression
        * `body` - a macro body
        * `binding` - a macro binding vector

## Collections

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure
> than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures. <br/>
> -- Alan J. Perlis

* Avoid the use of lists for generic data storage (unless a list is exactly what you need).
* Prefer the use of keywords for hash keys.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    {:name "Bruce" :age 30}

    ;; bad
    {"name" "Bruce" "age" 30}
    ```

* Prefer the use of the literal collection syntax where
  applicable. However, when defining sets, only use literal syntax
  when the values are compile time constants

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    [1 2 3]
    #{1 2 3}
    (hash-set (func1) (func2)) ; values determined at runtime

    ;; bad
    (vector 1 2 3)
    (hash-set 1 2 3)
    #{(func1) (func2)} ; will throw runtime exception if (func1) = (func2)
    ```

* Avoid accessing collection members by index whenever possible.

* Prefer the use of keywords as functions for retrieving values from
  maps, where applicable.

    ```Clojure
    (def m {:name "Bruce" :age 30})

    ;; good
    (:name m)

    ;; bad - too verbose
    (get m :name)

    ;; bad - susceptible to NPEs
    (m :name)
    ```

* Leverage the fact that most collections are functions of their elements.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (filter #{\a \e \o \i \u} "this is a test")

    ;; bad - too ugly to share
    ```

* Leverage the fact that keywords can be used as functions of a collection.

    ```Clojure
    ((juxt :a :b) {:a "ala" :b "bala"})
    ```

* Avoid the use of transient collections, except for performance-critical portions
of the code.

* Avoid the use of Java collections.

* Avoid the use of Java arrays, except for interop scenarios and performance-critical
code dealing heavily with primitive types.

## Mutation

### Refs

* Consider wrapping all IO calls with the `io!` macro to avoid nasty
surprises if you accidentally end up calling such code in a
transaction.
* Avoid the use of `ref-set` whenever possible.
* Try to keep the size of transactions (the amount of work encapsulated in them)
as small as possible.
* Avoid having both short- and long-running transactions interacting
  with the same Ref.

### Agents

* Use `send` only for actions that are CPU bound and don't block on IO
  or other threads.
* Use `send-off` for actions that might block, sleep, or otherwise tie
  up the thread.

### Atoms

* Avoid atom updates inside STM transactions.
* Avoid the use of `reset!` whenever possible.

## Strings

* Prefer the string manipulation functions from `clojure.string` next to
using the Java interop or unrolling your own.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (clojure.string/upper-case "bruce")

    ;; bad
    (.toUpperCase "bruce")
    ```

## Exceptions

* Reuse existing exception types. Idiomatic Clojure code, when it does
  throw an exception, throws an exception of a standard type
  (e.g. `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`,
  `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`,
  `java.lang.IllegalStateException`, `java.io.IOException`).
* Favor the use of `with-open` over the use of `finally`.

## Macros

* Don't write a macro if a function will do.
* Create an example of a macro usage first and the macro afterwards.
* Break complicated macros into smaller functions whenever possible.
* A macro should usually just provide syntactic sugar and the core of
  the macro should be a plain function. Doing so will improve
  composability.
* Prefer syntax quoted forms over building lists manually.

## Comments

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
> comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this
> comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make
> it even clearer. <br/>
> -- Steve McConnell

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!

* Write heading comments with at least four semicolons.

* Write top-level comments with three semicolons.

* Write comments on a particular fragment of code before that fragment
and aligned with it, using two semicolons.

* Write margin comments with one semicolon.

* Always have at least one space between the semicolon
and the text that follows it.

    ```Clojure
    ;;;; Frob Grovel

    ;;; This section of code has some important implications:
    ;;;   1. Foo.
    ;;;   2. Bar.
    ;;;   3. Baz.

    (defn fnord [zarquon]
      ;; If zob, then veeblefitz.
      (quux zot
            mumble             ; Zibblefrotz.
            frotz))
    ```

* Comments longer than a word begin with a capital letter and use punctuation. Separate
  sentences with [one space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing).
* Avoid superfluous comments.

    ```Clojure
    ;; bad
    (inc counter) ; increments counter by one
    ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
at all.
* Prefer the use of the `#_` reader macro over a regular comment when
you need to comment out a particular form.

    ```Clojure
    ;; good
    (+ foo #_(bar x) delta)

    ;; bad
    (+ foo
       ;; (bar x)
       delta)
    ```

> Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation. <br/>
> -- Russ Olsen

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to

### Comment Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented as much as the first one.
* Tag the annotation with your initials and a date so its relevance can
  be easily verified.

    ```Clojure
    (defn some-fun
      []
      ;; FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v1.2.3. It may
      ;;        be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade. (xz 13-1-31)
      (baz))
    ```

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
  be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
  with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

    ```Clojure
    (defn bar
      []
      (sleep 100)) ; OPTIMIZE
    ```

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause
  performance problems.
* Use `HACK` to note "code smells" where questionable coding practices
  were used and should be refactored away.
* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it
  is working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the
  client does X currently?`
* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be
  sure to document them in your project's `README` or similar.

## Existential

* Code in a functional way, avoiding mutation when that makes sense.
* Be consistent. In an ideal world, be consistent with these guidelines.
* Use common sense.

# Contributing

Nothing written in this guide is set in stone. It's my desire to work
together with everyone interested in Clojure coding style, so that we could
ultimately create a resource that will be beneficial to the entire Clojure
community.

Feel free to open tickets or send pull requests with improvements. Thanks in
advance for your help!

# Spread the Word

A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that
doesn't know about its existence. Tweet about the guide, share it with
your friends and colleagues. Every comment, suggestion or opinion we
get makes the guide just a little bit better. And we want to have the
best possible guide, don't we?
